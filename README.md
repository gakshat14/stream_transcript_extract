# Microsoft Stream Transcript Extractor

## Introduction

Over the last 2 years, our studies have migrated from in-person classes to online classes. No one is to blame here for COVID other than our only egg-laying mammal. In any case, we use Microsoft Webstream for all of the lectures, and all of these lectures have transcripts associated with them.  
Now, if I say that, what if there is somewhat of an easier way to extract those transcripts? That would make our lives a hell of a lot easier. If you have observed that these transcripts sometimes contain very important information that is not present in the slides, That's why I created this extension, which extracts all the transcripts and presents them to you in a way that you can easily copy and paste them wherever you want them.

## Directions

1.  Launch the developer tools by pressing `F12` or `CTRL+SHIFT+I`.
2.  Next, click on the double arrow (>>) to see **"StreCript"** and click on it.
3.  After this, you should see a welcome screen and an extract button.
4.  Before clicking on the extract button and without closing the developer tools, reload the page.
5.  Now click on the extract button and if the extension is able to find the transcript, it will be shown in the box below.

I know that sometimes it can be a pain to open the developer tools, but this was the only way that I could extract the text.

**Note: If you are sure that the transcript is present for that video, please reload the page with _StreCript_ open and then click _Extract_.**
